# Purpose
The purpose of the app was to facilitate diving the price among people that go on trips together. The app offers users the option to opt in and out of contributing towards paying items. It calculates a share of what a user will pay. The app itself does not allow for payments. 

# For the Future:
I wish to add a feature that once all users have finished choosing what items they are opting in and out of, they can all lock the trip and pay their share (not through the app)  

# Features:
- User Authentication (firebase backend)
- Users are able to opt in and out of paying for a portion of certain items
- Item are divided among members who wish to contribute
- Users can create trips
- Owners of trips may invite others to share their trip list
- Owners may add required fees that members can not opt out of
- All users can delete items they've added to a list
- Owner of a list may delete required items uploaded 

# Wireframes (very rough sorry):
![A wireframe, hopefully it shows up][TripSpendingApp/Wireframe/wireframe1.png]

# Testing:
Please test with at least 2 accounts to see how a lot of these features work. The app is meant to be used by multiple people to calculate how much money they are due after a trip.

# Thanks for reading have fun :)
